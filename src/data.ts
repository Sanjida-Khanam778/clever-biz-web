    question: "How will students interact with the AI tutor?",
    answer: `Students can engage with the AI tutor in several ways for a seamless learning experience. They can:
Type their questions directly into the chat interface: This is ideal for quick queries and specific problems.
Upload homework or problem sets as an image: Our AI will analyze the image, identify the problems, and allow students to work through them with guidance.
Potentially speak their questions: Our voice input allows for an even more natural interaction.
The AI will then analyze the student's input, highlight any errors, and provide step-by-step correct solutions with clear explanations. This ensures the student not only gets the right answer but also understands the underlying concepts.
